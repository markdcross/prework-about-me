      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I've been in Richmond for a little over two years, and I am the head of sales for a local education startup, EdConnective.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Annapolis, Maryland, my wife and I relocated to Richmond in early 2018.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Aside from hiking and just generally being outdoors, I'm a homebrewer. Last year I earned my Professional Beer Brewer's certificate through the University of Richmond.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>This is a tough question because I don't know what I don't know. I've made a successful career in sales and as a sales leader, but I want to adjust my trajectory to include more creativity.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>My wife and I (and our attack cat) are on the southside (Reedy Creek). If you haven't eaten at Laura Lee's, we highly recommend it!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love creating things. The ability to create while simultaneously thinking critically and solving puzzles is a perfect storm for my brain.</p>
